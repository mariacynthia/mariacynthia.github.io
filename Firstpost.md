Goodbye, UofT Entrepreneurship!

 Yesterday was my last day as academic director of UT Entrepreneurship. Today (well, tomorrow – happy Canada Day!), I'm back in my research lab, where it all started: enjoying the process of scientific discovery, while creating ways for new knowledge to be turned into products that lead to real-world benefits for society.  
 
 It's been 20 years since we started the research that led to Axela Biosensors, and 10 years since my students and I developed the nanoscience that is the basis for Vive Crop Protection. In the past ten years I had training programs and guided students in building science-based startups, founding the Impact Centre, and later by becoming the inaugural director of UTEntrepreneurship.
 
 Today, entrepreneurship programs abound. The Impact Centre that we envisioned as its founders is unfortunately gone for reasons beyond our control. Let the past be past – it's time to move on. For me it means going back to the lab for new discoveries that will be the basis of new products – in fact, we already have three in the works! The goal remains the same – _“Science to Society”_ – but with a new perspective that comes from being older and wiser that will bring discoveries to benefit society quicker and better. 
  
  Keep an eye out for what comes next, and reach out if you share this passion for creating impact!
